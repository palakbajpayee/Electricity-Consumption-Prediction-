## Introduction

This project utilizes a machine learning model to predict electricity consumption based on historical data. The model is built using Python and leverages key data preprocessing and machine learning libraries to provide accurate predictions. Key functionalities of this project include:

* Loading and preprocessing historical electricity production data.
* Training a machine learning model to predict future electricity consumption.
* Providing an interactive user interface for predictions using Streamlit.
* Extracting and transforming date features to enhance prediction accuracy.

Additionally, this project demonstrates the integration of data handling, feature engineering, and machine learning pipelines to create a robust predictive model.
